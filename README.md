# Prepare for ratelimits
This is a meme made about b1nzy, a [Discord](https://discordapp.com) developer.

He likes ratelimiting people.

Also, there's this guy called meew0. He hates eyes. He uses the light theme. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

## Keyboard shortcuts
- `s` => skip the current song
- `l` => toggle light theme
- `v` => toggle visualizer
- `m` => increment meew0 mode
- `up arrow` => increment audio volume
- `down arrow` => decrement  audio volume
